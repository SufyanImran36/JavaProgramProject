			<h3>Write any issues and/or observations that helped you install and setup IntelliJ on your computer</h3>
				<p>Downloading IntelliJ IDEA was staright forward because a direct link was provided, but running the IDE on my PC had high Latency, I believe you need certain CPU power to Run the IDE smoothly. downloading made made it quite easy aswell because I have downloaded Other IDE's aswell when programming, such as DevC++ and Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

			<h3>Write any issues and/or observations that helped you use GitHub.</h3>
				<p>Git hub Verison was not getting detected by IntelliJ despite downloading github, hence to to solve this issue and upload on time, I found that adding files manually would save time, and processing time, because IntelliJ was talking quite alot of time to process requests.</p>
